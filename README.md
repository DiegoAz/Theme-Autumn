# Theme - Autumn

## About

  This is a theme and color scheme inspired by autumn colors. It was made with the help of [Flatland](https://github.com/thinkpixellab/flatland) and the Default theme. The above because I preserve the tabs, scrollbars and search text field from the Default theme because I like.

## Note about Sublime Text 3 (Build 3143)

  Because this theme was referencing images in the Theme - Default that no longer exist you need to download [this](https://github.com/DiegoAz/Theme-Autumn/raw/master/Theme%20-%20Default.zip) file and unzip the folder into the Sublime packages directory. It is the Theme - Default before build 3143. See [this](https://forum.sublimetext.com/t/very-colorful-tabs/31244) post to get more information.
