- COLOUR SCHEMES

  I have consolidated the colour schemes in 4 according to sublime default scopes (http://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/scope_naming.html#color_schemes).

  The names of this schemes are based on the string colors and they were chosen with the help of this tool: http://chir.ag/projects/name-that-color

  If you are usign Autumn color scheme choose now, Autumn - Peach Orange, or try the other ones.

- "FOLDERS"

  I have added another option. I hope someone likes it.

    //"theme_autumn_rose_folders": true,
  
- CUSTOMIZING

  To facilitate changes to the color schemes I have added the .styluscheme files used to generate the color schemes. To do this make use of this helpful package: https://packagecontrol.io/packages/CSScheme 

- OPTIONS

  I have changed the options according to sublime text options (- to _):

	"theme_autumn_flat_buttons": true,
	"theme_autumn_orange_folders": true,
	//"theme_autumn_gray_folders": true,
  //"theme_autumn_rose_folders": true,
	"theme_autumn_roboto_font": true, //  You need to install Roboto Font and Roboto Font Medium
